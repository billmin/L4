# complementary for multiple tasks (aka states in our FSM)
# type of cases:
# 	A) navigation related cases.
# 	B) driving style related cases.
	C) traffic infrastructure related cases.
# 	D) temporary roadwork, emergency, safety related cases.
############################################################
# type A:
	1) follow_traffic_stream.
	2) flow_into_traffic_stream_on_left.
	3) flow_into_traffic_stream_on_right.
	4) flow_out_of_traffic_stream_on_left.
	5) flow_out_of_traffic_stream_on_right.
where 1)-5) shall be translated into basic driving skills.
Notice: type-A FSM is a base FSM. From any of the states, we can make transition to FSM states of type-B, type-C or type-D


# type B:
	1) car_following_with_patience (if front vehicle is slow, you can bear this)
	2) overtake_on_left (if front vehicle is slow, you can't bear that and overtake it on left side; Also if failed, it must abort, ie, return to initial lane)
	3) overtake_on_right (if front vehicle is slow, you can't bear that and overtake it on right side; Also if failed, it must abort, ie, return to initial lane)
where 1)-3) shall be translated into basic driving skills


# type C:
	1) traffic_light_is_red
	2) traffic_light_is_green
	3) traffic_light_is_yellow_or_blackout
	4) speed_limit_sign
where 1)-3) shall be translated into basic driving skills


# type D:
	1) slow_to_avoid_collision_with_obstacle (obstacle may be pedestrian!)
	2) turn_left_to_bypass_obstacle (including but not limited to lane-change-to-left; Also if failed, it must abort, ie, slow down immediately)
	3) turn_right_to_bypass_obstacle (including but not limited to lane-change-to-right; Also if failed, it must abort, ie, slow down immediately)
where 1)-3) shall be translated into basic driving skills


# 最小驾驶模型's basic driving skills (considering implementing the following skills in a class):
	1) lane_keep (stay in lane center, which may need be estimated when lane line is unclear)
	2) wide_speed_range_cruise (including distance keeping with front vehicle, obstacle, stop line etc if existing & speed keeping under speed limitation, keeping low speed whenever needed)
	3) go_left (full function with safety checking, including but not limited to lane-change-to-left, eg. turn left regardless of lane)
	4) go_right (full function with safety checking, including but not limited to lane-change-to-right, eg. turn right regardless of lane)
